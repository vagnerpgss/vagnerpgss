## Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineer.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Python**, **Data Engineering**, and **AI**.  
- 🔍 My current focus includes:  
  - Building and optimizing **data pipelines**.  
  - Exploring **machine learning models** and their applications.  
  - Deep diving into tools like **Apache Kafka**, **Airflow**, **Trino** and **MageAI**.  
- 📂 Check out some of my projects:
  - [Python Parallelism](https://github.com/vagnerpgss/python-parallelism): Demonstrating parallelism techniques in Python.  
  - [Data Ingestion Pipeline](https://github.com/vagnerpgss): A custom ETL pipeline using Python and PostgreSQL (placeholder).
- 💬 To ask me a question about software development, you can start a thread [here](https://github.com/vagnerpgss/vagnerpgss/issues)
